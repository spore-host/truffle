// CHANGELOG.md is policy, not decoration: CLAUDE.md requires an entry under
// `## [Unreleased]` in the SAME PR as any user-facing change, and the release ritual
// promotes that section verbatim into a dated one. Nothing checked either half, and
// both broke within a week:
//
//   - In spawn, a PR (#627) merged with no changelog entry at all. Nobody noticed until the next
//     release found an EMPTY [Unreleased] section and the entries had to be
//     reconstructed from the diff at tag time — exactly when you least want to be
//     reverse-engineering what a change did.
//   - Three PRs each inserted their own `### Added` at the top of [Unreleased].
//     That merges cleanly for git and badly for Keep a Changelog: the section ended
//     up with duplicate `### Added` and `### Fixed` headers, which had to be
//     consolidated by hand at release time. It then happened a second time.
//
// These tests cover the format half, which is checkable from the file alone. The
// "did this PR update the changelog" half needs the base branch, so it lives in CI
// (.github/workflows/ci.yml, "Changelog gate").
